## 📝 Development Notes

### Authentication Implementation Details
- **Server Actions vs API Routes:** Chose Server Actions for better type safety, progressive enhancement, and cleaner architecture
- **Session Strategy:** Using JWT instead of database sessions for better performance
- **Password Security:** bcryptjs with 12 rounds for secure password hashing
- **Form Validation:** Zod schemas for both client and server-side validation

### Database Design Decisions
- **User Model:** Separate firstName/lastName instead of single name field for better personalization
- **Prisma Relations:** Designed for future features (applications, resumes, recruiter contacts)
- **Cloud Database:** Neon PostgreSQL for easy deployment and scaling

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Component Library:** shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible components
- **Design System:** Clean, modern interface with proper loading states
- **Navigation:** Simple sidebar navigation with clear hierarchy
